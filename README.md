## What I learned 🤓

📌 **Semantic HTML** tags for better structure and accessibility.

📌 The `box-sizing: border-box` property for consistent element sizing.

📌 Differences between units like `px`, `rem`, and `em` for responsive design.

📌 Controlling text overflow with `text-wrap`.

📌 Using **logical properties** like `margin-inline` and `inline-size` for more flexible layout management.

📌 The `aspect-ratio` property to maintain proportions of elements.

📌 Adjusting images with `object-fit` and `object-position`.

📌 Working with `line-height` for better text readability.

📌 Styling text with `text-decoration` and its variations:
+ `text-decoration-style`
+ `text-decoration-color`
+ `text-decoration-offset`
+ `text-decoration-thickness`
+ `text-underline-offset`

📌 Creating scale effects using `transform: scale()`.

📌 Implementing smooth transitions with `transition`.

📌 Managing layer order with `z-index`.
